bio: |
  I am a Research Scientist at [Google research in New York](https://research.google/locations/new-york/). 
  I am interested in problems in machine learning, computer vision, and computational photography.
  
  I received my PhD advised by [Todd Zickler](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~zickler/) 
  at [Harvard University](https://seas.harvard.edu/), and did my undergraduate studies at [IIT 
  Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/). Before joining Google, I was an assistant professor of 
  computer science at [WashU](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/), a research assistant professor at 
  the [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago](https://www.ttic.edu/), and a post-doctoral 
  fellow at Harvard.
